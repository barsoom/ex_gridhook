# ExGridhook

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/barsoom/ex_gridhook.svg?style=svg&circle-token=fc0c22ab268d4f8a9a2f9c5aeac964bc815ef5cd)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/barsoom/ex_gridhook)

ExGridhook is an app to receive and persist SendGrid webhook events.

We built this app since our previous solution couldn't handle the amount of events we receive from SendGrid.
This app should scale better. We haven't seen any issues so far.

## Endpoints

* "/"         shows a friendly message.
* "/revision" returns the current git revison of the app.
* "/events"   receives SendGrid events and persists them.

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start the Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can navigate to [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

## Production

[Phoenix Framework's "Introduction to Deployment" guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html)

This app deploys to Heroku via CircleCI.

[CircleCI configuration](.circleci/config.yml).

Deploys intentionally *do not* run migrations, because [Gridlook](https://github.com/barsoom/gridlook) is responsible for the production database structure. Migrations are only for dev/tests.

**For non-Auctionet.com users**

If you want to use this app, you should probably fork this repo and change how you persist data, CircleCI configuration and so onâ€¦

### Basic auth

In order to have some sort of security, this app uses basic auth for the `/events` endpoint.

    heroku config:set BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=<username you want to use> BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<password of your choosing>

### Generate secret key base

    heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(mix phoenix.gen.secret)

### Heroku build packs

    heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/barsoom/heroku-buildpack-shell-tools
    heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir

## Update Erlang/Elixir versions

We use https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir for Elixir/Erlang support on Heroku.

Edit `elixir_buildpack.config` and change the version numbers.

You can find supported prebuilt Erlang versions in the repo [HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir-otp-builds](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir-otp-builds/blob/master/otp-versions).
Supported Elixir prebuilds versions can be found [in Elixir's Releases section](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases).
